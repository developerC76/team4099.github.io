The 2024 FRC season was big for Team 4099! Our robot Nightingale competed HARD and made
During the 2024 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Zapdos. We participated in two district events, winning a blue banner in Bethesda, MD, and advancing to the semifinals in Alexandria, VA. These achievements propelled us to the District Championships in Fairfax, VA, where we earned the Innovation in Control and Creativity awards. Additionally, Sarah Yu, a dedicated team member, was honored as a FIRST Dean's List Finalist. Our success continued in Virginia, securing us a spot in the World Championships. For the first time in our team's history, we were the first pick in the playoffs at the World competition.
