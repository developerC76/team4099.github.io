competition_summary: |
    In Charged Up, two competing alliances are invited to process cubes and cones to bring energy to their community. Each alliance brings energy to their community by retrieving their game pieces from substations and scoring it into the grid. Human players provide the game pieces to the robots from the substations. In the final moments of each match, alliance robots race to dock or engage with their charge station.

During the 2023 FRC season, Team 4099 competed with our robot, Zapdos. We participated in two district events, winning a blue banner in Bethesda, MD, and advancing to the semifinals in Alexandria, VA. These achievements propelled us to the District Championships in Fairfax, VA, where we earned the Innovation in Control and Creativity awards. Additionally, Sarah Yu, a dedicated team member, was honored as a FIRST Dean's List Finalist. Our success continued in Virginia, securing us a spot in the World Championships. For the first time in our team's history, we were the first pick in the playoffs at the World competition.
