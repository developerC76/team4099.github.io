    <p>Team 4099 is very thankful to all of its mentors who help the team in various ways. Mentors provide their knowledge and experience to members of the team. They also provide some of their valuable time to the team to help them in building robots, to creating succesful outreach programs. If you would like to become a mentor, please look at our Support Us Page. Once again, Thanks to all of our mentors for helping us in so many ways!
