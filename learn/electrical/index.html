<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Electrical subteam wires up our robot and control system to make sure nothing goes wrong (but when it does its programming's fault).
    Electrical works hard to get the control system for the robot ready to go, and perfectly wired. They also work with pneumatics on the robot.
    If you have any questions about the subteam or anything we do, please contact us at contact@team4099.com. We'd be
    happy to answer any questions.
