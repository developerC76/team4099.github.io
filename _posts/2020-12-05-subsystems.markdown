Tuesday was once again our weekly recap for what each subsystem did last, and the link can be accessed [here] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hANxgBP6e9ni3nGPgGlV66Q_q_wX3wmGOi51F5rhMsU/edit?usp=sharing).

Additionally, on Tuesday, Controls had a mini meeting after the recap meeting in order to discuss future projects after the subsystems are finished.

Throughout the week the individual subsystem teams worked on their respective subsystems and that work will be able to be seen on next week's blog.

The weekly Strategy meeting was canceled this week, but Business still continued to work on their respective grants.
