Tuesday was our last day of subsystem sketching! The last subsystem to finish sketching was the climber and once we finished sketching it, we looked over and finalized the entire robot.

Thursday, the team went over how and why you would choose certain motors of others. This connected with what we learned during our physics workshops where we learned about stall torque and electricity, only now putting it in the context of motors. After our motors workshop ended, we split off into our subsystem groups and decided what motors we would use for our respective subsystems.

Saturday our Business workshop got canceled, but Strategy still met up. Strategy is making progress creating Tableau visualizations for our scouting data analysis app. They’re continuing to look at previous years’ games, so they will be coming up with our own match strategies for those games this week.
