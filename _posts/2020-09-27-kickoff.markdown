Today was the second part of our kickoff, and we discussed how the subsystems should be made. We did this by splitting off into different groups focused on a subsystem. A problem that arose was a limit on motors as the drivetrain would take 12. After the different groups discussed what we should do, we regrouped and explained our evaluations to the team.
Now we know an idea of what our robot looks like, subteams can now start working on the bot!
