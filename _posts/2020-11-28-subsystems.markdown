Wednesday was the Weekly Business sync and few tasks were given as it was Thanksgiving Break.

Saturday was Strategy's meeting and after they shared scouting app updates, they wrapped up their analyses of previous yearsâ€™ games. Then they shared findings after going through the strategy offseason training template and discussed some.
