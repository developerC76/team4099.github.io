Tuesday the team as a whole recapped over what they did in the previous week. The Design portion for each of the subsystems has been going smoothly with certain parts of each subsystem completed. For Controls, each subsystem finished the basic outline for creating the class and commands. Additionally, each team afterwards decided respective times for when to meet up.

For the rest of the week each subsystem worked, and what each subsystem did in greater detail can be seen [here] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hANxgBP6e9ni3nGPgGlV66Q_q_wX3wmGOi51F5rhMsU/edit?usp=sharing).

Saturday, Business mainly recapped their progress on grants and discussed future plans. Strategy had a pretty short meeting - just updates on where they have gotten with combining visualizations for the scouting data analysis application and where they're headed next week with finishing up their analyses of previous yearsâ€™ games.
