Week 3 of workshops started on Tuesday. Design went over utilizing extrude in Onshape as well as using feature scripts to create tubing from prisms and create gussets for tubing. Additionally, they went over assemblies and using different types of mates to attach components. Controls on the other hand went over the basics of PID. The involvement and use of calculus resulted in some confusion, but the leads cleared up confusion.

This week's Business Sync had to be done without a meeting due to certain problems, however everything went as normal.

On Thursday Design and Mechanical went over Onshape variables, tips & tricks that make cad more efficient / fast as well as setting up MKCAD so that you can use better parts. Finally, they went over how to do gears in Onshape, as well as belt/chain/pulleys. Controls went over unit types and motion profiles. Members then practiced with motion profiling, PID, and unit types by creating a subsystem that utilizes these.

Friday was our notion workshop. Notion is a new way of organizing our documents and discussions our team has adopted this year. Many returning members and newcomers attended to learn how it worked and the purposes of it.
