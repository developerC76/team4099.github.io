Tuesday was the start of week 2 of our workshops. Fabrication & Design worked on learning the basics of CAD and using Onshape. Controls worked on learning how to code motor controllers 
and making basic subsystem commands. In the workshop, newcomers experienced difficulty 
creating the new class for the subsystem commands, while fixing mistakes in their subsystem object. In the end, most members were able to fix their mistakes and pushed their updates to 
their own branch [here](https://github.com/team4099/Workshop-2020-09-17).

Wednesday was our weekly business sync. The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) curriculum we are currently developing is progressing smoothly, with the basics hopefully being
completed by the next sync. Next, our Chairman's Award script just needs general revisions and needs to be condensed. Each member is currently working on contacting a 
company and our AstraZeneca grant application still needs to be tuned. 

Thursday was the second day of workshops this week. Those who attended the Design workshop learned basic designs for the subsystems related to Infinite Recharge. For 
example, members learned the different designs for a shooter such as a turret and variable hood. Controls having learned how to create a basic subsystem with commands, 
were tasked with assigning a command to a button on a controller. For instance, members were tasked with assigning the A button on a controller to make the intake spin 
inwards.
