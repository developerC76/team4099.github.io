                    FalconCamps are week-long classes for middle and high school students about concepts and skills used
                    in FRC ranging from
                    introductory to experienced levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At FalconCamps, students will learn about STEM topics that interest them in an interactive and
                    friendly environment.
                    They will work on projects using what they have learned to develop a deeper understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FalconCamps consist of 5 two hour online meetings with a 4:1 camper to counselor ratio. Campers will
                    work together on
                    some parts of their project to foster teamwork and to provide a fun learning environment. Lessons
                    will be taught by
                    experienced members of our team with knowledge in the topic.

                        Monday: Introducing Java! We will go over the basics, such as getting a sentence to print to
                        your
                        screen and
                        understanding the flow of code.

                        Tuesday: How does code work with robots? By the end of the day, you will get hands-on experience
                        with coding a part of a
                        robot to run.

                        Wednesday: Today we will get our subsystem to take feedback from a controller and learn how to
                        put
                        our code on GitHub.

                        Thursday: What makes our code run on the robot? Today is all about understanding the files that
                        the
                        robot runs and how
                        we can use them. You will also be introduced to your final project!

                        we
                        can use it to detect
                        a target. Using the working vision algorithm, we will incorporate it into a closed loop
                        subsystem.
                        Then we can make
                        motion profiles that we will tune.

                This session covers the basics of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and mechanical design thinking. We take a
                look
                at the
                thought process behind robot mechanisms and some complex robot CAD. This all leads up into the final
                project
                of creating
                your own full mechanism!

                        experience

                        CAD and
                        mechanical design skills they’ve learned over the week.

                This course covers the optimal usage and mathematical analysis of FRC hardware. In addition, we
                take a deeper dive into
                the more complex features of Onshape and FRC-specific tips and tricks. The final project is to
                fully CAD a robot
                subsystem from scratch!

        FAQ
    </div>
    <p class="accordion">Q: Who is Team 4099 and how are you qualified to teach these camps?
    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: Team 4099 is Poolesville High School’s FIRST Robotics team, based out of Poolesville, MD. We
        design, build, wire, and
        program robots to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Team members design and build these robots from
        scratch
        (robots consist of upwards of 300 custom designed and machined parts, as well as over 10,000 lines of code
        written over
        the course of a 2-month build season). Team 4099 is teaching the same content that members master over the
        course of
        this build season -- let our competition robots speak for <a href="team4099.com/about/robots"></a></div>

    <p class="accordion">Q: Who are the camp instructors?
    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: The camp instructors will consist of adult mentors as well as student members of Team
        4099. All instructors have mastery over the content they are teaching.
    </div>

    <p class="accordion">Q. What happened to last year’s RoboCamps and how are FalconCamps different?
    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we, unfortunately, cannot run RoboCamps this year due to social
        distancing and health
        risks. RoboCamps were focused on teaching robotics concepts to elementary and middle school students through VEX
        IQ
        robots in a hands-on classroom setting. FalconCamps instead focus on teaching engineering and programming
        concepts to
        middle and high school students in a distance learning environment. RoboCamps will be back next year though!
    </div>

    <p class="accordion">Q: What will a FalconCamps session look like?

    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: Sessions will have 20 participants and 5 counselors. The session opens with an interactive
        lecture led by one of our
        counselors, where everybody is able to ask questions. We then break up into groups of 4 students and 1
        counselor, where
        students ask questions, do interactive work designed to hone the skills taught in the lecture, and discuss in a
        small
        group.
        .</div>

    <p class="accordion">Q: Who are FalconCamps meant for?

    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: There are three main groups of people that FalconCamps were designed for:
        <ul>

            <li>Any middle and high school students who want to learn more about mechanical design or programming
            </li>
            <li> middle or high school aged students who plan to join Team 4099 or any other FIRST Robotics Competition
                team, and
                want to have a head start on the content these teams need
            </li>
            <li>Any high school students, or older mentors, on FIRST Robotics Competition teams that do not have
                significant programming
                mentorship, or don’t do much CAD, but want their team to get better in these areas.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="accordion">Q: My child has no experience with robotics, CAD, or programming. Can they still participate?
    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: Yes! Our camp is geared towards students of all ages and all experience levels. No
        previous CAD experience or programming experience is required for the beginner sessions. However, we do require
        some
        experience for the intermediate sessions. Check each session for more info.
    </div>

    <p class="accordion">Q: I am interested in attending FalconCamps, but cost is an issue.

    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: We understand that during the current economic situation, the $100 cost may be difficult for
        some to pay. If cost is
        a barrier to you for registration, please email us and we can discuss options. Team 4099’s goal is to help
        children and
        teams learn, regardless of economic circumstances.</div>

    <p class="accordion">Q: I am a mentor on an FRC team, but want to learn more about design/programming through these
        camps. Can I sign up?
    </p>
    <div class="panel">A: Sure! We do not have a maximum age for the camps.
    </div>

    <p class="accordion">Q: What sets these camps apart from online resources and workshops put out by FIRST teams?
    </p>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>A: There’s a couple of things that set FalconCamps apart.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, the learning environment is more structured, which
            works better for many students. Many students have a harder time learning from random videos found on
            YouTube and the
            occasional post on online forums than they do with one-on-one discussion. FalconCamps offers a more
            structured,
            personalized learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, Team 4099 has found that while there are plenty of online resources for advanced level learning
            for FRC
            concepts, there is a lot of content missing for students at the beginner and intermediate concepts who may,
            for example,
            have never used CAD software before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Team 4099 greatly appreciates all of the content that is out there and is freely available for use by all
            teams (many of
            our team members learned from these resources). FalconCamps act as a supplement, rather than a replacement,
            for this
            content.
        </p>
